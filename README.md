# Patatap Clone

Patatap is a fun and relaxing way to spend time on the internet. Here is a clone of Patatap that I built as part of Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp Course. 

Features to Add:
- "PataTrump": I think it would be really funny to make a site just like this but instead of circles and sounds, make Trump's head pop up and use an actual voice clip of him saying a single word
- a record button
